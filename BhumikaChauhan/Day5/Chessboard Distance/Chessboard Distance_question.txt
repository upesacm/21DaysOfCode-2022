Problem
The Chessboard Distance for any two points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) on a Cartesian plane is defined as max(|X1 - X2|, |Y1 - Y2|)​.
You are given two points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2). Output their Chessboard Distance.

Note that, |P| denotes the absolute value of integer P. For example, |-4| = 4 and |7| = 7.

Input Format
First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing 4 space separated integers - X1, Y1, X2, Y2  - as defined in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the chessboard distance between (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2)

Constraints
