Problem
Chef has 2 numbers A and B(A<B).
Chef will perform some operations on A.

In the i th operation:
Chef will add 1 to A if i is odd.
Chef will add 2 to A if i is even.
Chef can stop at any instant. Can Chef make A equal to B?

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers A and B.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if Chef can make A and B equal, NO otherwise.

Note that the checker is case-insensitive. So, YES, Yes, yEs are all considered same.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤A<B≤10^9
