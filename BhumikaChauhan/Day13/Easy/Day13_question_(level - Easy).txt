Problem
In a contest where N new users visited the contest,

A users just saw the problems and didn’t make any submissions and hence won’t get any rating.
B users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly. Thus, after the contest, they will get a rating in the range 800 - 1000.
Everyone else could correctly solve at least 1 problem. Thus, they will get a rating strictly greater than 1000 after the contest.
You need to output the number of new users in the contest who, after the contest, will get a rating and also the number of new users who will get a rating strictly greater than 1000.

Input Format
Each input file contains of a single line, with three integers N, AN,A and BB - the number of new users, the number of users who just saw the problem and didn't make any submission, and the number of users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly.

Output Format
Output two integers separated by a space in a single line - the number of new users who will get a rating at the end of the contest and the number of new users who will get a rating higher than 1000.
