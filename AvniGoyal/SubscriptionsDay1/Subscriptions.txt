A new TV streaming service was recently started in Chefland called the Chef-TV.
A group of NN friends in Chefland want to buy Chef-TV subscriptions. We know that 66 people can share one Chef-TV subscription.
Also, the cost of one Chef-TV subscription is XX rupees. Determine the minimum total cost that the group of NN friends will incur so
that everyone in the group is able to use Chef-TV.
