Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer .
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Here, o<= i<=x, o<=j<=y, o<=k<=z.
Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.
