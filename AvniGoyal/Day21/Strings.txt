You are given two strings, a and b, separated by a new line. Each string will consist of lower case Latin characters ('a'-'z').
in the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively.
In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b (a+b).
In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a' and b'. a' and b' are the same as a and b, respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.
