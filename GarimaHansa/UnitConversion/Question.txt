I tried to make a Unit conversion program in C. Since, I am a beginner I only included 5 conversions.


PROBLEM FACING:
The output I am getting after running the program is not the desired output. It is having a lot of places after the decimal poiny. I even tried using %.2f to try and round it off but it is not working. 
Please run it and tell me where am I wrong.
